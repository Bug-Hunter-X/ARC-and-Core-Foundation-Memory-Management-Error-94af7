In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with the interaction between ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and Core Foundation objects.  Consider this scenario: 

```objectivec
CFStringRef cfString = CFStringCreateWithCString(kCFAllocatorDefault, "Hello, world!", kCFStringEncodingUTF8);
NSString *nsString = (__bridge NSString *)cfString;
// ... some operations with nsString ...
CFRelease(cfString);
```

The error lies in prematurely releasing `cfString` before `nsString` is done with it.  Even though ARC manages `nsString`, it doesn't automatically handle the underlying Core Foundation object. Releasing `cfString` too early leads to a dangling pointer and potential crashes.
